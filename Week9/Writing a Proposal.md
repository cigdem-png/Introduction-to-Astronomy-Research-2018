# Writing a Research Proposal #
By: Isabel Angelo (2018)
Here are some basic guidelines on how to write a good research proposal.

### 1. Choose a topic and question to answer ###
This part is a bit tricky- not only do we need a topic that is interesting to us, but we also need one that is impactiful and feasible.
An *impactful* research question is one that is important in the field. 
In other words, answering the question provides insights into ongoing research and/or opens doors to new projects in the future.
A *feasible* project is one that is reasonable given contemporary restrictions due to funding, instrumentation, and time. 
When you're starting to think of topics or questions you want to answer, don't worry too much about these requirements.
The important part is writing down all your ideas and learning what you're interested in. After that, you can go through and tweak ideas
to become more feasible and impactful. 

### 2. Outline how you will answer your question ###
Think about what type of data or knowledge you will need in order to answer your research question. It may be helpful to research different 
telescopes and instruments, or look at papers that have tackled similar research topics. For the purposes of this class, you don't need to worry too much about whether or not you have the proper time, resources, and resolution, and you can feel free to move on to #3. 

If you are writing a proposal for a real research project, one of your main concerns will be the feasibility of the project. In other words, once you have found out the type of data and what you need to observe, make sure it is possible. 
Do you have the resolution you need? Does your project require a reasonable amount of data and observing time? 
Are you able to mark out a path for how to solve it? 

### 3. Think about why your question is important ###
Why is your question interesting? How does is tie in to research that has already been conducted in the field? What can we gain from knowing the 
answer yo your question? 

The answers to these questions can vary. It may be that you want to find clues that contribute to a broader theoretical question such as "how do planets form?",
or learm something specific about a particular system- "is there oxygen in the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1d"? Your project can govern what we know about the fundamental physics 
of planet-star systems, or it can provide a small piece of information as part of a larger survey of planet and star properties.
As long as it answers a question, it is helpful to the field as a whole!

### 4. Write your proposal ###
Once you have given some thought to your project, you're ready to write your proposal. In general, you want your proposal
to give background on the specific sub-field of your project, explain what you wish to research and how, and why this is an important 
question to answer. 

Here is a list of questions your proposal should answer:
- What do you plan to research?
- Why is this topic interesting?
- How do you plan to do it? (i.e. what instruments will you need? how much time? do you have the resolution?)
- What can we learn from your results?

And now with all you've learned, you're ready to draft your proposal! Don't forget to have fun with it- research proposals are an amazing opportunity to answer questions that no one knows the answer to, and you could be the first one. Good luck!
