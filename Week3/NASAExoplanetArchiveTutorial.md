## NASA Exoplanet Archive Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will:
- learn about the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- use the NASA Exoplanet Archive to get parameters for confirmed exoplanets.
- plot a mass-radius diagram

## Learn about the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- Navigate to the NASA Exoplanet Archive (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).
- Click 'Confirmed Exoplanets' to access the data.
- Make a mass-radius diagram using the online interface.
- Download the data, then replicate plots in Python using matplotlib.pyplot

## Plot in Python
- Using pandas.read_csv and matplotlibl.pyplot.plot, make the mass-radius diagram in Python.l
- Note any interesting features of the plot.

## For more practice
- Download additional data of interest from the Archive, make scatter plots for these online and in Python.
