## NASA Exoplanet Archive Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will:
- learn about the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- use the NASA Exoplanet Archive to get parameters for confirmed exoplanets.
- plot a mass-radius diagram

## Learn about the NASA Exoplanet Archive
- Navigate to the NASA Exoplanet Archive (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).
- Click 'Confirmed Exoplanets' to access the data.
- Make a mass-radius diagram using the online interface.
- Download the data, then replicate plots in Python using matplotlib.pyplot

## Plot in Python
- Using pandas.read_csv and matplotlibl.pyplot.plot, make the mass-radius diagram in Python.l
- Note any interesting features of the plot.

## For more practice
- Download additional data of interest from the Archive, make scatter plots for these online and in Python.

## Note to instructor 
The guided tutorial part of this lesson includes a screen share of the instructors web browser, 
while navigating the Exoplanet Archive page. The instructor should show how to modify columns,
remove NaN values from the table, and show how to select from the many options in the NEA. 
The instructor should also guide the students through plotting a mass-radius diagram using the ICE
plotter on NEA. Lastly, the instructor should code a script for reproducing this plot in python
using matplotlib.pyplot on screen, explaining in detail what each command and argument do.
