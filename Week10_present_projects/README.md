### Paper to discuss:
"Life Outside the Solar System" by Su-Shu Huang https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v202/n4/pdf/scientificamerican0460-55.pdf

### Discussion of Research Topics
- Any questions about final projects so far?
- Each student will spend 5 minutes (no slides) describing their project to the class.
- Remember to post your research proposals on your website.

### Writing Exercise
- Please spend 5 minutes reflecting on your favorite part of the summer program, and describe the topics you found most useful.


Teaching notes: We had each student produce one question on the paper, in the chat, in order to engage the students. Each student then read their question, and the mentors can answer accordingly.
