### Making a CV

For this week's assignment, we are going to create our own academic curriculum vitae, or CV. 

## But first: what is LaTeX?
LaTeX is a formatting language that is commonly used to create scientific documents for publication. We write our text in LaTeX 
so that we can control the way the text is formatted and presented. To read more about LaTex, visit The LATEX project:
https://www.latex-project.org/

For our tutorial, we will use an LaTex text editor called overleaf. Overleaf is a website that provides LaTeX templates 
to edit yourself. This makes it user-friednly and a great introduction to learning LaTeX.

#Step 1:
Make an account on overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/).

#Step 2: 
Select the Resume/CV template that you would like to use.

#Step 3: 
Edit the source text/LaTeX code on the left side of the template with your information to create your own personal CV!
