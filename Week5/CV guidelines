### Making a CV

For this week's assignment, we are going to create our own academic curriculum vitae, or CV. 

## But first: what is LaTeX?
LaTeX is a formatting language that is commonly used to create scientific documents for publication. We write our text in LaTeX 
so that we can control the way the text is formatted and presented. To read more about LaTex, visit The LATEX project:
https://www.latex-project.org/

For our tutorial, we will use an LaTex text editor called overleaf. Overleaf is a website that provides LaTeX templates 
to edit yourself. This makes it user-friednly and a great introduction to learning LaTeX.

#Step 1:
Make an account on overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/).

#Step 2: 
Select the Resume/CV template that you would like to use.

#Step 3: 
Edit the source text/LaTeX code on the left side of the template with your information to create your own personal CV!

## What goes in a CV?

A Curriculum Vitae, or an academic resume, serves to summarize your accomplishments in a compact format that is used for job interviews, grant proposals, tends to be of general interst to people who want to connect with you in academia. Categories can vary depending on your specific qualifications, but there are some common categories that go in most academic CV's. There are others that are common but not mandatory, and are meant to highlight the unique skills and experience of the individual.

common categories: education, research experience, honors and awards, publications, posters/talks/conferences attended, teaching/volunteer work/outreach, coursework, technical skills (the last two are less common post-undergrad, but are super helpful for applying to research positions)

other optional categories: observing experience, languages, extracurriculars, 

*note:* if you don't have anything to fill out for some of these categories, don't worry! They are a good thing to keep in mind for the future, but are by no means necessary for starting to do research. These categories can take years (often an entire undergraduate career) to build up
