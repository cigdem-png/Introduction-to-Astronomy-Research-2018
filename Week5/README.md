1. Alma: Creating a Website

# Assignments:
1. Look up the personal websites (NOT university faculty page!) of at least five different astronomers. Explore them in detail. Write an entry in your notebook describing what you like and what you don't like. Remember, a website is often times many people's first impression of you, what do you want them to know? Also remember to consider content as well as aesthetics. Use this in planning a design for your personal website. Extra: Look up the websites of scientists from other academic fields (e.g. biology, chemistry, psychology) and compare. Do you notice any similarities? Differences?

2. Read this article on building a website: https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/sites/default/files/2017-11/ECR_Building_personal_website_210912.pdf.

3. Create a website using the platform of your choice. You may use a template or create a site from scratch.
