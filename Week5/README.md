### Intro (Howard)
- Intro, Check-in. The Future of Astronomy: Communication and Collaboration.

### Recap of the Direct Imaging Paper (Becky):
  The Bowler (2016) exoplanet paper remains a classic paper because of it's thorough and complete recap of directly imaged planets at that time. Becky will take us through some of the highlights of the paper. Be prepared with questions that you encountered when reading the paper and everyone should be prepared to discuss one interesting point from the paper.

### Tutorial: 
2. Isabel: Creating a Curriculum Vitae; aka a CV.

# Assignments:
1. Look up the personal websites (NOT university faculty page!) of at least five different astronomers. Explore them in detail. Write an entry in your notebook describing what you like and what you don't like. Remember, a website is often times many people's first impression of you, what do you want them to know? Also remember to consider content as well as aesthetics. Use this in planning a design for your personal website.

2. Read this article on building a website: https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/sites/default/files/2017-11/ECR_Building_personal_website_210912.pdf.

3. Create a website using the platform of your choice. You may use a template or create a site from scratch.

4. Create an account on overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) and make a draft of a CV! See the "CV Guidelines" for more information.
