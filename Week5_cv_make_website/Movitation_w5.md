### Communication and Collaboration in Astronomy:

In today's lesson, our mentors will lead you through examples of how to build a professional website and Curriculum Vitae or CV. 
These will become two of the methods that you will use to communicate your work and your interest in astronomy to your colleagues 
and to the public. A third method of communication also begins with this program, that is building your network of colleagues. As a testament
of the importance of your professional website and professional network, everyone is here today because they either contacted me via email,
through my website or through a reference from one my colleagues. 

As you think about what you want to include on your website, it is important to make include relevent information regarding what your interests 
and accomplishments are in astronomy. Additionaly, it can be beneficial to separate your personal interests from your professional interests.
In the world of social media personal and professional networks can become one in the same, but today we will be discussing how to make 
a professional website and encouraging you focus on this aspsect of your life and interests.

A Curriculum Vitae, or an academic resume, serves to summarize your accomplishments in a compact format that is used for job interviews, 
grant proposals, tends to be of general interst to people who want to connect with you in academia. Details often include education, conferences
attended and papers that you have wrtitten or to which you have contributed. 

Astronomy, now more than ever, is a collaborative science. While the history of astronomy is filled with romantic mountain top observatories 
built in remote outposts, and solitary scientists toiling late at night, this practice is fading away (but not gone yet). 
As the techincal requirements of missions become more and more complicated and large investments are spent on monolithic projects such as 
the James Webb Space Telescope, and Gaia missions, among others, collaboration and the ability to get along with you colleagues is 
becoming not just a desired quality for employers, but a requirement. The Hubble Space telescope employs over 50 people just to support the 
telescope, not to mention the hundreds of scientists who apply for time every proposal cycle. The Kepler Space Telescope and recently launhced 
TESS mission have similar numbers of collabortors. In an extreme example of large collaborations, the LIGO collaboration has over 1200 
scientists. 

With a solid web presence and CV, you will be better positioned to acquire your first (and later) positions in astronomy. This will eventually 
lead toward job offers, conference invitations, and invitations from people in your community to help with outreach events. So think of 
your website as an open invitation for collaboration to your future colleagues from all over the world.
