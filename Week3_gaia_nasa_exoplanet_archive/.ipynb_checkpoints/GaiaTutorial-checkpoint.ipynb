    "#### Written by Sarah Blunt, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- learn about the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL)\n",
    "- use the Gaia DR2 Database and the NASA Exoplanet Archive to get Gaia parameters for the 10,000 closest stars\n",
    "- plot a color-magnitude diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- This tutorial is challenging! If you spend more than 15 minutes stuck on a task, post about it on Piazza (you can post anonymously if you want). An instructor will help you out! Don't struggle needlessly.\n",
    "- Make sure you complete the pandas and matplotlib tutorials before attempting this tutorial."
