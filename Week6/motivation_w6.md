The Kepler Spacecraft was launched on March 7th 2009 and was installed into an Earth trailing orbit. Such an orbit, that slowly drifts away
from the Earth over time allows Kepler to maintain a low radiation environment, which is mainly caused by the Earth's magnetic field and 
radiation belts. It's position, along with the long awaited CCD array and ability to observe 24 hours a day allowed Kepler to collect the 
brightness measurements of 200,000 stars over 4 years that would revolutionize exoplanetary science as well as many parts of stellar 
astrophysics. 

Entire subfields of astronomy that had preivously been theorized, but unsupported by observation, came to life as the photometric precision, 
or the ability to precisely measure the brightnesses of stars over time, allowed topics such as asteroseismology, and transit timing variation 
analysis to blossem.
