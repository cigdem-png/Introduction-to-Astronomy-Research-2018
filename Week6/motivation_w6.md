The Kepler Spacecraft was launched on March 7th 2009 and was installed into an Earth trailing orbit. Such an orbit, that slowly drifts away
from the Earth over time allows Kepler to maintain a low radiation environment, which is mainly caused by the Earth's magnetic field and 
radiation belts. It's position, along with the long awaited CCD array and ability to observe 24 hours a day allowed Kepler to collect the 
brightness measurements of 200,000 stars over 4 years that would revolutionize exoplanetary science as well as many parts of stellar 
astrophysics. 

Entire subfields of astronomy that had preivously been theorized, but unsupported by observation, have come to life as the photometric 
precision, or the ability to precisely measure the brightnesses of stars over time, has allowed topics such as asteroseismology, and 
transit timing variation analysis to blossom. 

Specifically in the exoplanet realm, Kepler was the first to make many discoveries and here are some of the most consequential. When Kepler launched, previous transit search missions had found planets as small as Neptune in single planet systems. The number of transiting hot Jupiters was already in 1000's, but radial velocity surveys had shown that planets in the mass range between Jupiter and Neptune were more common than the hot Jupiters. Up this point, the greatest discoveries for Kepler were still hidden in the noise. Within the first 30 days of data, in the first data download, the number of small planets was already far larger than anticipated, and excitement grew. We immediately started using our ground based telescopes to follow-up Kepler's findings.

Within the first year of Kepler's launch, we had found the first multi-planet transiting system, and the first circumbinary planet. We measured the mass of the first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. The orbital period of the planet is only one day, meaning that it is super close to its host star. Kepler-11 was discovered to host 6 planets in its system. All six would lie closer to the sun than Venus, and all 6 are smaller than Neptune. 

As more and more planets rolled in, astronomers began to study the statistic of transiting planets, accounting for the angle at which we view a transiting planet, and calculating how many planets are there, that are not transiting. It soon became clear that nearly every star in the galactic neighborhood hosts at least one planet. And stars like the sun are more likely to host planets than not. When looking for planets that near in size to the Earth, that recieve about the same amount of energy from their host star, Kepler found that about 1 in 5 stars like the sun has a planet like the Earth, a remarkable finding that will be one of the legacies of Kepler.

Using Kepler's data, in addition to dozens of ground based telescopes across the United States and the world, astromers carried the field into the Kepler Era. The knowledge that Earth like planets are common changed the way that people look at the sky, and forces us to re-orient ourselves in the cosmos. Hopefully Kepler will continue to inspire the next generation of astronomers to gaze at the stars and wonder what other secrets they are hiding.
