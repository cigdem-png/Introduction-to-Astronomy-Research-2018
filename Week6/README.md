# Agenda:

### Howard: Intro
- Check-in, and a few words about NASA's Kepler Spacecraft.

### Review of Websites created last week. (Alma)

### Writing Exercise: 
In your online notebooks, please spend 10 minutes responding to the following prompts:

    1. Make a list of attributes that make up a good academic website. What do you think is important to include? 
    
    2. Write down what you remember from previous weeks about Kepler, transits, and photometry.
    
### Tutorials:
1. Isabel: Downloading, analyzing and plotting Kepler Data with the Kepler Photometry Tutorial

### Paper of the Week:
An Earth-sized Planet in the Habitable Zone of a Cool Star (Quintana et al. 2014)

*description: This paper does a great job of describing in detail how Kepler planets are found and confirmed. It also provides meaningful contributions to ongoing conversations about astrobiology and exoplanet habitability.*

 Questions to think about as you read:
 
 (1) What properties (mass, radius, composition, temperature, etc.) can we learn about exoplanets from *Kepler*?
 
 (2) What are the shortcomings of *Kepler*? What properties are we not able to learn about planets from transit data alone?
 
 (3) What factors do we look for to determine if a planet is "habitable"?
 
 (4) What are some next steps we can take after discovering a *Kepler* planet to learn more about it's properties?


# Assignments:
