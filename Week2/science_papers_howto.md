### Introduction to Reading Scientific Papers ###
This introduction goes through the basics of how to effectively read a scientific paper. We also provide some resources that are commonly used in asronomy to make find. reading, and storing papers much easier.

## How to find scientific papers: ##
Use Astrophysics Data System or ADS:

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu

ADS is a database where journal articles in astrophysics are stored. You can query the database by typing in the author, title, or other relevant information about a paper. The search engine will return a list of matches to your search, from which you can find the paper you are looking for.

 ## Download and store papers: ##
 Mendeley is a great application to track the many scientific papers that you will use throughout your careers.
 
https://www.mendeley.com

Mendeley allows you to download papers and keep them stored in a single, organized library on your own computer. You can also sort papers into cetegories and annotate them (similar to google docs) so you can have notes, definitions, etc. on-hand.

## Close-reading science papers: ##
 During class this week, we discussed this paper, which uses direct imaging to discover and confirm and exoplanet:
 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07514.pdf

 For your assignment this week, please read the paper of the week (NOT the above paper, although you can read it if you'd like!) thoroughly. Try to observe the following note-taking strategy (or use something similar that works for you):
- highlight words you don't know in one color. Look up their definitions and write them down as in-text notes as you read.
- highlight key ideas in another color.
- keep a general note with summaries of each paragraph
- keep a general note with summaries of each section
- keep a note with 10-word or less summaries of each figure
- keep a note with overall questions you have about the paper. Some of these you may resolve as you read-- once you've finished reading the paper, revisit this note and see how many of your own questions you can answer!
 Once you've read the whole paper, post 2-3 remaining questions you have on our class piazza page. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!
