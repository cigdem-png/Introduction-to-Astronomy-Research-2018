### Numpy:

Main Website:
http://www.numpy.org

Tutorial for this week:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html

Bonus round: 100 Numpy commands 
https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
(This notebook can be cloned to your local computer)

### Astropy: 
The astropy module has many of the essential and useful functions that Astronomers use on a daily basis. 
From the perspective of an observer, we can use astropy for planning and carrying out observations at the telescope.
All of the different astronomical units can be accessed from astropy, as well automated web querying, which is useful
for the future of big data, when you want to download thousands of astronomical targets' information in a single command.

Main Website:

Use the 'Download Tutorial Notebook' link

Bonus Round Astropy tutorial:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/quantities.html
No need to worrry about plotting yet. We will cover that next week.

### Scipy:
https://scipy.org

Scipy is an incredibly powerful module for conducting high level scientific computing. Because we are 
focusing on the basics of scientific computing in this class, only a single basic tutorial will be assigned.
For those of you who desire more depth, please explore the full tutorials page linked from the scipy homepage.

### Paper of the week:
During my time as a researcher in Astronomy. Those astronomers using ground based telescopes to follow up
on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler Mission came to some amazing conclusions. They are summarized here:

"Occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1â€“4x Earth-size planets around Sun-like stars"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2960.pdf

How to find scientific papers: Use Astrophysics Data System or ADS:

### Writing prompt

Mendeley is a great application to track the many scientific papers that you will use throughout your careers.
