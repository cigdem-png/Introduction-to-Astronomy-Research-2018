0) Announcement about Piazza:
   - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) is a free service for students to communicate with instructors and with each other. 
   - You should have received an email invitation to join our private Piazza group.
   - If you have questions about assignments, readings, etc. (either logisitical or technical), please post them on Piazza.
   - There is an option to post anonymously. 
   - We will periodicially ask you to post questions, reply to other students' questions, etc. on Piazza.
   - Make sure you familiarize yourself with the Piazza platform this week.

1) Review/Checkin from last week:
   - How did the tutorials go?
   - What should the instructors do differently this week?

2) Short Tutorial on IPython, Jupyter, and git. Instructor screenshares, and:
   - Git clones this repository.
   - Shows how to open a Jupyter notebook in this repository from the command line.
   - Opens iPython, and executes a few commands. 
   - Gives their 2 cents on when to use iPython, when to use Jupyter, and when to write a script.
   - Explains the purpose of Scipy and Astropy, and (if time) executes a few commands in each package.

3) How to read a scientific paper
   - See [Introduction to Reading Scientific Papers](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Introduction-to-Astronomy-Research/blob/master/Week2/science_papers_intro.md).
   - Instructor goes through the abstract, introduction, and figures of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07514.pdf) with students, explaining in detail their method for reading scientific papers. 

4) Writing prompt

### Writing Prompt

Please spend 10-15 minutes of your own time assessing your progress by writing in your online notebooks. Did you complete as many of the assignments as you wanted to last week? Are you happy with your progress? What will you do similarly and differently this week? What are the most important things you learned last week?

## Assignments for this Week:

### Numpy:

Main Website:
http://www.numpy.org

Tutorial for this week:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html

Bonus round: 100 Numpy commands 
https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
(This notebook can be cloned to your local computer)

### Astropy: 
The astropy module has many of the essential and useful functions that Astronomers use on a daily basis. 
From the perspective of an observer, we can use astropy for planning and carrying out observations at the telescope.
All of the different astronomical units can be accessed from astropy, as well automated web querying, which is useful
for the future of big data, when you want to download thousands of astronomical targets' information in a single command.

Main Website:
http://www.astropy.org

Tutorial for this week:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/Coordinates-Intro.html
Use the 'Download Tutorial Notebook' link

Bonus Round Astropy tutorial:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/quantities.html
No need to worrry about plotting yet. We will cover that next week.

### Scipy:
https://scipy.org

Scipy is an incredibly powerful module for conducting high level scientific computing. Because we are 
focusing on the basics of scientific computing in this class, only a single basic tutorial will be assigned.
For those of you who desire more depth, please explore the full tutorials page linked from the scipy homepage.

### Paper of the week:
"Occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1â€“4x Earth-size planets around Sun-like stars"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2960.pdf

Take the next two weeks to read and digest this paper. Refer to our [Introduction to Reading Scientific Papers](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Introduction-to-Astronomy-Research/blob/master/Week2/science_papers_intro.md) guide for advice!
