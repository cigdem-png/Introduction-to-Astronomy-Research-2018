1) Review/Checkin from last week:

2) Short Tutorial on IPython, Jupyter, and git.
   - Git clone this repository.
   - Show advantage of Jupyter, Jupyter labs over Ipython.
   - Quick overview of Scipy, Astropy

3) How to read a scientific paper

3) Writing prompt   

## Assignments for this Week:

### Writing Prompt

This week, please spend 10-15 minutes of your own time assessing your progress by writing in your online notebooks. Did you complete as many of the assignments as you wanted to last week? Are you happy with your progress? What will you do similarly and differently this week? What are the most important things you learned last week?

### Numpy:

Main Website:
http://www.numpy.org

Tutorial for this week:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html

Bonus round: 100 Numpy commands 
https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
(This notebook can be cloned to your local computer)

### Astropy: 
The astropy module has many of the essential and useful functions that Astronomers use on a daily basis. 
From the perspective of an observer, we can use astropy for planning and carrying out observations at the telescope.
All of the different astronomical units can be accessed from astropy, as well automated web querying, which is useful
for the future of big data, when you want to download thousands of astronomical targets' information in a single command.

Main Website:

Use the 'Download Tutorial Notebook' link

Bonus Round Astropy tutorial:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/quantities.html
No need to worrry about plotting yet. We will cover that next week.

### Scipy:
https://scipy.org

Scipy is an incredibly powerful module for conducting high level scientific computing. Because we are 
focusing on the basics of scientific computing in this class, only a single basic tutorial will be assigned.
For those of you who desire more depth, please explore the full tutorials page linked from the scipy homepage.

### Paper of the week:
During my time as a researcher in Astronomy. Those astronomers using ground based telescopes to follow up
on discoveries made by NASA's Kepler Mission came to some amazing conclusions. They are summarized here:

"Occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1â€“4x Earth-size planets around Sun-like stars"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2960.pdf

How to find scientific papers: Use Astrophysics Data System or ADS:
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu

Mendeley is a great application to track the many scientific papers that you will use throughout your careers.
https://www.mendeley.com

During class, we discussed this paper, which uses direct imaging to discover and confirm and exoplanet:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07514.pdf



For your assignment this week, please read the paper of the week (NOT the above paper, although you can read it if you'd like!) thoroughly. Try to observe the following note-taking strategy (or use something similar that works for you):
- highlight words you don't know in one color. Look up their definitions and write them down as in-text notes as you read.
- highlight key ideas in another color.
- keep a general note with summaries of each paragraph
- keep a general note with summaries of each section
- keep a note with 10-word or less summaries of each figure
- keep a note with overall questions you have about the paper. Some of these you may resolve as you read-- once you've finished reading the paper, revisit this note and see how many of your own questions you can answer!

Once you've read the whole paper, post 2-3 remaining questions you have on our class piazza page. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!
