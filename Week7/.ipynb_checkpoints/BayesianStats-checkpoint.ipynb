    "### Written by Sarah Blunt, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- understand Bayesian priors qualitatively\n",
    "- perform a radvel orbit fit\n",
    "- add errors in quadrature to estimate total error\n",
    "- improve your radvel orbit fit using Bayesian priors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before starting this tutorial, please watch the following videos:\n",
    "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK7X_XlGB8\n",
    "    - Note: I really like this speaker's way of explaining Bayesian concepts, but almost every example expresses stereotypical thinking about a group of people. Such stereotypes can be harmful in a number of ways, including discouraging people from pursuing science. [This link](https://www.dropbox.com/personal/Readings%20about%20Identity%20%26%20the%20Scientific%20Community/06%20The%20Scientist%20Identity%20Today?preview=Frink_Computer+Geeks.pdf) is one of many excellent articles providing examples of the effects of such stereotypes. I encourage you to keep these stereotypes in mind, but for now, focus on the content related to Bayesian statistics and priors. \n",

Think of it this way: we know from the transit fits that only a certain range of orbital periods are allowed, and that some orbital periods are more probable than others. We therefore add a [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) prior on orbital period to our orbit fit. This has the effect of penalizing orbit fits with orbital periods far away from the mean of the Gaussian. We do the same with Tc."
