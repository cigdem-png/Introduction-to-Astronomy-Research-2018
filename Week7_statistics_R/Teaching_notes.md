First: Motivation.

Then go ahead with statistics discussion. A discussion of the radial velocity technique, discussing how we divide up each spectrum into chunks and measure each one individually. This motivates the idea that we are using the mean of all of these small measurements to get the final and using the standard deviation as the uncertainty. When we fit the radial velocities to an orbit, we must add additional uncertainty that comes from the star. The formal uncertainties, as found by the standard deviation must be added to this jitter term, from the star in order to account for the full uncertainties in the measurements.  

Next, discuss the idea of prior probability and reveal how we can turn these into mathematical priors. For example, when fitting a transiting planet with RVs, we can put a prior ont he period, since we have a measurement of that from photometry.

The majority of this discussion is held in an informal setting. In the future, a walk through tutorial could be added showing basic examples of statistics and an example of priors, but preferably one not about astronomy.

For the Rstudio tutorial, walk students through the terminal navigation to the Intro to AStro folder via screenshare, do a  `git pull` (to re-iterate the basic commands) and review the installation commands, then open Rstudio with the tutorial. Show students the IDE and run the basic parts of the tutorial with a screen share. Go into enough detail so that those who have never seen Rstudio before will know how to run the tutorial. 

For the paper discussion, since everyone has already read the paper, begin with a writing prompt.  Follow that up with questions about the paper, and discuss some of the primary topics and variables such as "How does the stellar mass or brightness affect the transit depth." "Why is it easier to detect planets around low-mass stars". Focus on the visuals in the paper, and screen share to help lead the discussion.

Consider showing linear vs exponential growth examples in the tutorial. Add link to Spyder as IDE for Python.
