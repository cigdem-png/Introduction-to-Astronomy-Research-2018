An Introduction to Astronomy Research

## Welcome
 Welcome to the essential collection of information that you need to begin your journey into Research Astronomy. The following tutorials, projects and tips are designed to for early college students (and advanced high school students) to gain the skills they need in order to gain entry into a more formal research project. With exposure and eventual mastering of the skills contained in this repository, students will be better prepared to enter a formal research project either during the semester or over the summer.

## Target Audience
This course is designed to be conducted invidually or in a group setting. In the first iteration, the focus will be on intereaction among students in the group, and less focused on a top down teaching structure. That said, we also hope to provide the opportunity for students to brainstorm and plan their own research projects, a skill that often requires years of practice to master.

## Our Goals
After completion of these tutorials, students will have the skills need to quickly ramp up on new astronomy research projects, without the need to brush up on basic skills. The astronomy skills will be focused on, but not limited to exoplanet topics. Students are encouraged to use these skills to explore other realms of Astronomy

## The Future of the project:
We hope this project becomes self sustaining in such a way that others can contribute and add value to the current set of reserach skills presented here. If you have questions, comments or ideas, please feel free to contact us through the issue tracker on this repo.
