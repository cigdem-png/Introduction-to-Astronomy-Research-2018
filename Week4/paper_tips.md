## Instructor Tips for Quintana et al. (2014) ##

by: Isabel Angelo (2018)

We used this paper because we felt that it was necessary to include a discovery paper in order to provide a comprehensive introductory reading list on exoplanets. We chose this paper specifically because it is incredibly detailed and doubles as an introduction to discussing exoplanet habitability. Plus there was a ton of fun press surrounding it's release in 2014!

The first time we taught this class, we decided to focus on the main portion of the paper and leave the appendix and extra sections as optional to the readers. The entirety of the paper is very interesting and enriching, but the beginning section contains tons of information on its own and is less overwhelming to students as a first paper.

Also, the paper uses theoretical frameworks (isochrone/stellar evolution models, n-body simulataions, etc.) to interpret *Kepler* results. This is a great way to introduce students to the intersections between theory and exoplanet observation. However, this concept is a bit more difficult than others discussed in this paper and may require more rigorous descriptions in class.

Here is a list of (optional) questions for students to think about as they read, summarizing the general and introductory-level take-away ideas from the paper:

(1) What properties (mass, radius, composition, temperature, etc.) can we learn about exoplanets from Kepler?

(2) What are the shortcomings of Kepler? What properties are we not able to learn about planets from transit data alone?

(3) What factors do we look for to determine if a planet is "habitable"?

(4) What are some next steps we can take after discovering a Kepler planet to learn more about it's properties?

These are by no means mandatory or comprehensive, but I compiled it as a quick way to help students take away key ideas from the paper.

Enjoy!
