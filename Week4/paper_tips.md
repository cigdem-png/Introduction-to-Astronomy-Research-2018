Questions to think about as you read:

(1) What properties (mass, radius, composition, temperature, etc.) can we learn about exoplanets from Kepler?

(2) What are the shortcomings of Kepler? What properties are we not able to learn about planets from transit data alone?

(3) What factors do we look for to determine if a planet is "habitable"?

(4) What are some next steps we can take after discovering a Kepler planet to learn more about it's properties?
